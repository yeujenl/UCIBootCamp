## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Accuracy Score: 0.99
  * Precision for 0: 1.00, Precision for 1: 0.87
  * Recall for 0: 1.00, Precision for 1: 0.89

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* The model has a high accuracy of 0.99, precision and recall for both 0 and 1 are higher than 0.85, thus the model is a fairly accurate model.
* While it appears the model may be biased towards 0 (True) results, the balanced accuracy score is 0.94, so I believe the machine learning model can still be recommended.
